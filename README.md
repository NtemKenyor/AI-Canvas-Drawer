# AI-Canvas-Drawer
AI Canvas Drawer is a web-based application that allows users to generate and draw complex shapes and elements on a canvas using an AI-driven approach. The application receives a text prompt from the user, sends it to an AI API, and returns a standardized JSON structure containing the shapes to be drawn on the canvas.
